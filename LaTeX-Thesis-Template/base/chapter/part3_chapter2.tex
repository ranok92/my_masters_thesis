\section{Methodology}
The entire pipeline consists of 4 disjoint modules.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The environment (discussed in the previous section).
    \item The RL block.
    \item The feature extractor.
    \item The IRL block.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{RL block}
We are using a vanilla actor-critic method. Description of the algorithm along with the mathematics involved.
\subsection{Feature Extractor}
Feature extractor is an important part of the pipeline. 
Some of the talking points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The plethora of feature extractors tested on.
    \item Description of each of the feature extractors.
    \item (maybe add an analysis of different feature extractors and the corresponding agent performances and to why and how the behaviour of the agent is shaped by the feature extractor used.)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{IRL block}
