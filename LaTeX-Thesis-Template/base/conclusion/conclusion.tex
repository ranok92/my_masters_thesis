\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present a data-driven approach to creating a controller that can navigate through human crowds in a socially acceptable manner. The need for 'socially acceptable' navigators is important as if it is not socially acceptable, then robots deployed in the vicinity of humans will make others uncomfortable. 
We propose a novel feature representation that better captures the world around the agent and introduce a smoothing technique in the DeepIRL training pipeline, that leads faster and more stable training. 
The model we train perform better than the other non-model-based methods and other feature representations sharing similar training frameworks and are closest to that of the actual pedestrians 
We also introduce a simulator that is customized to go with the task of social navigation with a lot of bells and whistles. 

\section{Future Work}
The controller can also be used for prediction.
End to end model removing the need for hand-engineered feature representations.
use of a hierarchical control architecture to control different aspects of navigation.
Can be deployed in real-world robots
