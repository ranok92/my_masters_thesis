\chapter*{\rm\bfseries Abstract}
The ability to navigate autonomously is one of the primary milestones of mobile robots. And with the increasing rate of deployment of robots in the proximity of humans, a socially compliant navigation system is a necessity. We define socially compliant navigation as a form of navigation that in addition to satisfying the principles of classical navigation, maintains some form semblance to the way humans move through crowds. Generally, this is an amalgamation of several factors including but not limited to personal preferences, social and cultural norms, and present circumstances, making the problem quite challenging.\\
In this work, we present a navigation pipeline using maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning (MEDIRL) that relies on expert demonstrations to learn social compliance. The primary contributions of this thesis lie in the adaptation of MEDIRL in a model-free environment and a set of novel yet simple feature representation that captures relevant information from the environment enabling the agent to navigate in a humanlike way. The policies produced from the method generate trajectories that have a greater resemblance to human demonstrations when compared to other existing methods while maintaining comparable performance in the task of classical navigation
