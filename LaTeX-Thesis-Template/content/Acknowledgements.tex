\chapter*{\rm\bfseries Acknowledgments}

I would like to start by thanking my supervisor, Prof. Gregory Dudek and co-supervisor Prof. David Meger for their constant support in every step of the journey. Their feedback on my progress, enthusiasm at my success and motivation during rough patches were the reward function that helped me successfully navigate my Masters. %have played a vital role in helping me in my journery. 

I would also like to thank my collaborator, Bobak Hamed Baghi, with whom I had the pleasure of working. The brainstorming sessions and those endless hours of scribbling on the whiteboard are something that I will always cherish.  
%Thank the members of the lab for helping me out when stuck and bringing a fresh perspective.\\


Too many cooks spoil the broth. Fortunately, that was not the case. Being a part of a large research group helped me be in touch with people with similar interests which facilitated exchange of interesting ideas. Not to mention the help and support I received from the members of the lab. %While there are too many to name, the morning coffee with Xiru, discussion on IRL with WeiDi, not so serious discussion with Lucas and endless scribbling on the whiteboard with Bobak are some of the more memorable ones I have.

Special thanks to Jean-Fran\c cois Tremblay for taking time out of his busy schedule to help me translate my abstract in French.


Resources are a vital part of any research. The computational resources necessary for the project was supplied by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and Samsung Electronics provided the financial support.


It is important to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and that is what friends are for. A shout out to Nitin, Vishal, Aashima, Aakash, Mamal, Monalisha and Baishali: an incredible group of people that I met, laughed, exchanged ideas and made memories. Thank you for being a part of the story.

"In time of test, family is best." I feel fortunate to have an incredible family: my father, mother and sister. I cannot thank you enough to be there by my side through thick and thin. You inspire me to be a better person and this would not be possible without you.
